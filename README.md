### Documentation
brief and wireframes are located in /documentation

### Git Flow
Master starts with a simple "under construction" wireframe and is updated when the desig reaches a launchable state, and after updates. Development is done in the branch Development. When the desig reaches a launchable state Development is merged into Master.

Experiments are preformed in the branch Practice. Never merge the branch Practice with any other branch.

### Commits
Master branch only commits when the design can be launched.
Development branch commits when the design is viable.
Practice branch commits whenever.
